# 100DaysofMLCode
This repository is a part of #100DaysofMLCode challenge. That means, I pledge to code machine learning for at least an hour everyday for the next 100 days.
Challenge is starting from July 06, 2018.

## Day 1: July 06, 2018

### What I did ?

1. Perform the <b>classification task</b> on <b>Breast Cancer</b> dataset.
2. By Using, Keras (Tensorflow as a backend).
3. Achieve the accuracy near to <b>96%</b> after using <b>'Relu'</b> as an activation function.

### What is Keras ?

<b>Keras</b> is a high-level machine learning framework for Python under the MIT license.
To know more, see Keras official [documentation](https://keras.io/).
